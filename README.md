Hi, I'm a human person that loves reading books, manhwa, novel, 
and just simply everything that you can read. Also, I absolutely enjoy 
watching movies, dramas and any kind of films. Furthermore, my most favorite hobby other 
than reading and watching films is eating delicious foods and dessert. As you can 
see from the things I like, these are things I can do at home alone. Thus, 
if you haven't noticed from the clues above, I am an introvert and that is pretty 
much my whole character is all about.
