> Hi, I'm a human who loves reading books, manhwa, novelsâ€”basically anything readable. I also enjoy watching movies, dramas, and all kinds of films. Additionally, my favorite hobby besides reading and watching is indulging in delicious food and desserts. Given my interests, I prefer activities I can do alone at home. If you haven't noticed already, I am an introvert, and that pretty much sums up my personality.
